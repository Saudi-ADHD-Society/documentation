## Desktop App access to organization repositories
If you are using Github Desktop or another desktop app, it may not automatically show the Saudi ADHD Society repositories in your repository list. If so, you need to go to Account Setting --> Integrations --> Applications --> Authorized OAuth Apps --> then Click on "The GitHub Desktop Development App" (or the name of your app) --> Under Organization access grant access (if admin) or send a request for the admin to grant access.
